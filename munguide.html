        <br>
        <p>This page was made for MUN lovers from Romania to keep them up-to-date regarding all the conferences they can participate in. We consider this a very important concept since the most popular method of announcing such events is Instagram. Not everybody has time to check every Instagram account and make a list of MUNs.
            <br><br><i>But we do.</i> </p>
        <br>
        <h><i>"Mmmkay, but why should I even go to a MUN?"</i></h>
        <br>
        <p><b>The memories you make.</b> Chances are, you're in high school, you hear everybody saying these are your most beautiful years, and you should appreciate that, but you don't feel like it. YOU. ARE. MISSING. OUT. There is nothing more special than reading all the things people wrote on your placard. There is no better feeling in this world than exploring the country with your friends while going to an MUN. Late at night, you do your research, the next day you go to the conference, and after that you go out and have the time of your life. And this repeats for 3-4 days straight, and you KNOW that you have to appreciate it.<br><br><i>Time goes fast, don't miss out. And as we say, call a friend. Get your tickets. Pack your bags. Go to a MUN.</i><br><br> </p>

                        Hints: 
                        <li>
                            In many conferences, they will ask you to choose 3 different committees when you apply(<i>You don't have to, especially if you want a certain committee</i>)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Yes, the Secretariat reads all of your essays, so do your best when writing and take your time, it matters.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It is very nice to go with your friends, especially if you decided to go in another town <i>Find acommodation near the institution where the MUN takes place.</i> 
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    You got your role, now what?
                    <ol>
                        Here's what you can do : 
                        <li>
                            First of all, read the ROP ( Rules of Procedure ), especially if you are a first timer, it really helps because you will be aware of all the stages that the MUN will go through, every conference has slightly different rules.    
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Read the study guide, this is the most important part in all of this. The study guide is a document that contains most of the information you need to be prepared for the MUN. If you have the knowledge there is a bigger chance to be more confident when holding a speech so check Further Readings, it is a part at the end of most study guides where you can find aditional links and sources.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It is recommended to have a laptop at disposal so you can write down your speech, in most cases you will not have enough time so try to come prepared with some ideas. <i>(Most of us learned this the hard way)</i>.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li> 
                <li>
                    Now you're ready! Be confident and have fun. For more pieces of information:
